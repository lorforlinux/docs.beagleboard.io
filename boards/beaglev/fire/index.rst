BeagleV-Fire
###################

BeagleV®-Fire is a revolutionary SBC powered by the Microchip's PolarFire® MPFS025T RISC-V System on Chip 
(SoC) with FPGA fabric. BeagleV®-Fire opens up new horizons for developers, tinkerers, and the open-source community to explore the vast potential 
of RISC-V architecture and FPGA technology. It has the same P8 & P9 cape header pins as BeagleBone Black allowing you to stack your favorite BeagleBone 
cape on top to expand it's capability. Built around the powerful and energy-efficient RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) along with its versatile FPGA fabric, 
BeagleV®-Fire SBC offers unparalleled opportunities for developers, hobbyists, and researchers to explore and experiment with RISC-V technology.
