Power path
===========

The LM73100 is a power path management IC that can be used to seamlessly switch between multiple 
power sources to generate a stable system voltage (VSYS). In this design, we have three power 
sources: VIN_5V, USB_5V, and VBAT. Here's how each of these sources is utilized:

1. VIN_5V: This is typically the main power input, which could come from an external power adapter. The LM73100 prioritizes this input when it is available, ensuring that the system is powered by this stable and higher current source.
2. USB_5V: This input comes from a USB connection. When VIN_5V is not available, the LM73100 switches to USB_5V to power the system. This allows the device to be powered or charged via a USB connection when an external adapter is not connected.
3. VBAT: This is the battery voltage input. When neither VIN_5V nor USB_5V is available, the LM73100 switches to VBAT to ensure that the system remains powered. This is crucial for portable devices that need to operate on battery power when no external power sources are connected.

The LM73100 manages these inputs and switches between them to provide a stable VSYS output. It 
ensures that the highest priority power source is used first, and seamlessly transitions to the 
next available source if the current one is disconnected or falls below a certain threshold.

This power path management ensures that the system remains powered without interruption, 
providing a reliable and efficient power solution for various applications.
