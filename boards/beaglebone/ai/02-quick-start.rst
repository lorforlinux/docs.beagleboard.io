Fans
*****

The pre-attached heat sink has M3 holes spaced 20x20 mm. The height of
the heat sink clears the USB type A socket, and all other components on
the board except the 46-way header sockets and the Ethernet socket.

If you run all of the accelerators or have an older software image,
you’ll likely need fan. To find a fan, visit the link to `fans in the
FAQ <https://git.beagleboard.org/beagleboard/beaglebone-ai/-/wikis/Frequently-Asked-Questions#fans>`_.

.. caution::

   BeagleBone AI can run **HOT**! Even without running the accelerators,
   getting up to 70C is not uncommon.

Main Connection Scenarios
**************************

This section will describe how to connect the board for use. The board
can be configured in several different ways. Below we will walk through
the most common scenarios. NOTE: These connection scenarios are
dependent on the software image presently on your BeagleBone® AI. When
all else fails, follow the instructions at :ref:`upgrade-beaglebone-ai-software`.

-  :ref:`Tethered to a PC via USB C cable <bbai-tethered>`
-  :ref:`Standalone Desktop with powered USB hub, display, keyboard and mouse <bbai-standalone>`
-  :ref:`Wireless Connection to BeagleBone® AI <bbai-wireless>`

      **Tethered to a PC**

      The most common way to program BeagleBone® AI is via a USB connection to
      a PC. If your computer has a USB C type port, BeagleBone® AI will both
      communicate and receive power directly from the PC. If your computer
      does not support USB C type, you can utilize a powered USB C hub to
      power and connect to BeagleBone® AI which in turn will connect to your
      PC. You can also use a powered USB C hub to power and connect peripheral
      devices such as a USB camera. After booting, the board is accessed
      either as a USB storage device or via the browser on the PC. You will
      need Chrome or Firefox on the PC.

Connecting a 3 PIN Serial Debug Cable
*************************************

A 3 PIN serial debug cable can be helpful to debug when you need to view
the boot messages through a terminal program such as putty on your host
PC. This cable is not needed for most BeagleBone® AI boot up scenarios.

Cables: https://git.beagleboard.org/beagleboard/beaglebone-ai/-/wikis/Frequently-Asked-Questions#serial-cable

Locate the 3 PIN debug header on BeagleBone® AI, near the USB C connection.

.. image:: media/BB_AI_USBC_and_3pin_500px.png
   :align: center
   :alt: BeagleBone AI Overview

Press the small white connector into the 3 PIN debug header. The pinout is:

- Pin 1 (the pin closest to the screw-hole in the board. It is also marked with a shape on the silkscreen): GND
- Pin 2: UART1_RX (i.e. this is a BB-AI input pin)
- Pin 3: UART1_TX (i.e. BB-AI transmits out on this pin)
