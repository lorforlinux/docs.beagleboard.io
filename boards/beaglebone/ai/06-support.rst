Rev A1
=======

Second round prototype.

-  Fixed size of mounting holes.
-  Added LED for WiFi status.
-  Added microHDMI.
-  Changed eMMC voltage from 3.3V to 1.8V to support HS200.
-  Changed eMMC from 4GB to 16GB.
-  Changed serial debug header from 6-pin 100mil pitch to 3-pin 1.5mm pitch.
-  Switched expansion header from UART4 to UART5. The UART4 pins were used for the microHDMI.
