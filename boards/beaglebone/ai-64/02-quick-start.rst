1.  Tethered to a PC
2.  Standalone development platform in a PC configuration using external peripherals

.. _main-connection-scenarios:

Main Connection Scenarios
============================

This section describes how to connect and power the board and serves as a slightly more detailed 
description of the Quick Start Guide included in the box. The board can be configured in several 
different ways, but we will discuss the two most common scenarios.

* Tethered to a PC via the USB cable 
  
  * ``Board is accessed as a storage drive and virtual Ethernet connection.``
  
* Standalone Desktop 
  
  * ``Display``
  * ``Keyboard and Mouse``
  * ``External 5V > 3A power supply``

Each of these configurations is discussed in general terms in the following sections.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Tethered To A PC

      In this configuration, the board is powered by the PC via a single USB cable. The board is accessed either as a USB storage drive or via the browser on the connected PC. You need to use either Firefox or Chrome on the PC, Internet Explorer will not work properly. 

      .. figure:: images/ch03/usb-tethering.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Tethered Configuration

      At least 5V @ 3A is required to power the board, In most cases the PC may not be able to supply 
      sufficient power for the board unless the connection is made over a Type-C to Type-C cable. You 
      should always use an external 5V > 3A DC power supply connected to the barrel jack if you are 
      unsure that the system can provide the required power or are otherwise using a USB-A to Type-C 
      cable which will always require power from the DC barrel jack.

      **Connect the Cable to the Board**

      1. Connect the type C USB cable to the board as shown in the figure below. The connector is on the top side of the board near barrel jack.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/usb-c-connection.*

         USB Connection to the PC/Laptop

      3.  The board will power on and the power LED will be on as shown in the figure below.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/power-led.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Board Power LED

      4. When the board starts to the booting process started by the process of applying power, the LEDs will come on in sequence as shown in the figure below. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing in an erratic manner as it begins to boot the Linux kernel.

      **Accessing the Board as a Storage Drive**

      The board will appear around a USB Storage drive on your PC after thekernel has booted, which will take a round 10 seconds. The kernel on the board needs to boot before the port gets enumerated. Once the board appears as a storage drive, do the following:

      1.  Open the USB Drive folder.
      2.  Click on the file named **start.htm**
      3.  The file will be opened by your browser on the PC and you should get a display showing the Quick Start Guide.
      4.  Your board is now operational! Follow the instructions on your PC screen.

   .. group-tab:: Standalone w/Display and Keyboard/Mouse

      In this configuration, the board works more like a PC, totally free from any connection to a PC as shown in the figure below. It allows you to create your code to make the board do whatever you need it to do. It will however require certain common PC accessories. These accessories and instructions are described in the following section.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/desktop-configuration.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Desktop Configuration

      Ethernet cable and M.2 WiFi + Bluetooth card are optional. They can be used if network access required.

      **Required Accessories**

      In order to use the board in this configuration, you will need the following accessories:

      * 5V > 3A power supply.
      * Display Port or HDMI monitor.
      * miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI cable (or a recommended **miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI adapter** https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089GF8M87 has been tested and worked beautifully).
      * USB wired/wireless keyboard and mouse.
      * powered USB HUB (OPTIONAL). The board has only two USB Type-A host ports, so you may need to use a powered USB Hub if you wish to add additional USB devices, such as a USB WiFi adapter.
      * M.2 Bluetooth & WiFi module (OPTIONAL). For wireless connections, a USB WiFi adapter or a recommended M.2 WiFi module can provide wireless networking.

      **Connecting Up the Board**

      1. Connect the miniDP to DP or active miniDP to HDMI cable from your BeagleBone AI-64 to your monitor.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/monitor-cable.*

         Connect miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI cable to BeagleBone AI-64

      2. If you have an Display Port or HDMI monitor with HDMI-HDMI or DP-DP cable you can use adapters as shown in the figure below.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/display-adapters.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Display adapters

      3. If you have wired/wireless USB keyboard and mouse such as seen in the figure below, you need to plug the receiver in the USB host port of the board as shown in the figure below.

         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Keyboard and Mouse

      4. Connect the Ethernet Cable

      If you decide you want to connect to your local area network, an Ethernet cable can be used. 
      Connect the Ethernet Cable to the Ethernet port as shown in the figure below. Any 
      standard 100M Ethernet cable should work.

         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         External DC Power

      6. The cable needed to connect to your display is a miniDP-DP or active miniDP-HDMI. Connect the miniDP connector end to the board at this time. The connector is on the top side of the board as shown in the figure below.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/miniDP-connector.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         Connect miniDP to DP or active miniDP to HDMI Cable to the Board

      The connector is fairly robust, but we suggest that you not use the cable as a leash for your Beagle. Take proper care not to put too much stress on the connector or cable.

      7. Booting the Board

      As soon as the power is applied to the board, it will start the booting up process. When the board starts to boot the LEDs will come on. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing in an erratic manner as it boots the Linux kernel.

      .. figure:: images/ch03/leds.*
         :width: 740px
         :align: center 
         
         BeagleBone AI-64 LEDs

      While the four user LEDS can be over written and used as desired, they do have specific 
      meanings in the image that is shipped with the board once the Linux kernel has booted.

      * **USR0** is the heartbeat indicator from the Linux kernel.
      * **USR1** turns on when the microSD card is being accessed
      * **USR2** is an activity indicator. It turns on when the kernel is not in the idle loop.
      * **USR3** turns on when the onboard eMMC is being accessed.
      * **USR4** is an activity indicator for WiFi.

      8. A Booted System
         
         a. The board will have a mouse pointer appear on the screen as it enters the Linux boot step. You may have to move the physical mouse to get the mouse pointer to appear. The system can come up in the suspend mode with the monitor in a sleep mode.
         b. After a minute or two a login screen will appear. You do not have to do anything at this point.
         c. After a minute or two the desktop will appear. It should be similar to the one shown in the figure below. HOWEVER, it will change from one release to the next, so do not expect your system to look exactly like the one in the figure, but it will be very similar.
         d. And at this point you are ready to go! The figure below shows the desktop after booting.
