Understanding Boot
##################

There are several phases to BeaglePlay boot. The simplest place to take control of
the system is using :ref:`play-distro-boot`. It is simplest because it is very generic,
not at all specific to BeaglePlay or AM62, and was included in the earliest BeagleBoard.org Debian
images shipping pre-installed in the on-board flash.

.. _play-distro-boot:

Distro Boot
***********

For some background on distro boot, see `the u-boot documentation on
distro boot <https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/develop/distro.html>`_. There is
also `BeaglePlay specific u-boot documentation <https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/board/ti/am62x_beagleplay.html>`_.

In :ref:`play-typical-extlinux-conf`, you can see line 1 provides a label
and subsequent indented lines provide parameters for that boot option.

.. _play-typical-extlinux-conf:

.. code-block::
    :caption: Typical /boot/firmware/extlinux/extlinux.conf file
    :linenos:

        kernel /Image
        append root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootfstype=ext4 rootwait net.ifnames=0 quiet
        fdtdir /
        #fdtoverlays /overlays/<file>.dtbo
        initrd /initrd.img

It is important to note that this file is not on the root file system of BeaglePlay. It
is sitting on a separate FAT32 partition that is mounted at ``/boot/firmware``. You can
see the mounted file systems and their formats in :ref:`play-boot-mounted-fs`.

The FAT32 partition in this setup is often referred to as the boot file system.

To better understand BeaglePlay's U-Boot Distro Boot, let's install a Linux kernel and
initramfs from the `Buildroot project <http://buildroot.org/>`_. There is a pre-built image
release at https://git.beagleboard.org/beagleboard/buildroot/-/releases/2023.11-beagle1.

Currently, the Linux kernel image needs to be uncompressed and stored in the FAT32 file
system. An initramfs image is a simple way to provide a starting root file system. When
running Linux, some kind of root file system is required.

An initramfs image is utilized on Debian systems to make sure any kernel modules needed are
available and to provide a bit of a recovery opportunity in case the root file system is
corrupted. You can learn more about initramfs and initrd on `the Debian Initrd Wiki
page <https://wiki.debian.org/Initrd>` and `the Linux kernel documentation admin
guide initrd entry <https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/initrd.html>`.

In the case of utilizing Buildroot, the
entire `Linux distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>`_ is
incorporated into the initramfs root file system image.

The contents of the initrd can be read using ``lsinitramfs /boot/firmware/initrd.img``.
