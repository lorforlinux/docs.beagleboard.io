Connect WiFi
#############

.. note::
    A common issue experienced by users when connecting to Wireless networks are network names that include special characters 
    such as spaces, apostrophes etc, this may make connecting to your network more difficult. It is thus recommended to 
    rename your Wireless AP to something simpler. For Example - renaming "Boris's Wireless Network" to "BorisNet". 
    This avoids having to add special "escape" characters in the name. This shows up especially if you try connecting to 
    iPhone/iOS HotSpots, where the network name is the device name, which by default is something like "Dan's iPhone". 
    Also see `this potential solution. <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/679862/wpa-supplicant-conf-escaping-characters/>`_.


If you have a monitor and keyboard/mouse combo connected, the easiest way is to use :ref:`beagleplay-wifi-wpa-gui`.

Alternatively, you can use :ref:`wpa_cli instructions <beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli>` over a shell connection through:

* The :ref:`serial console <beagleplay-serial-console>`,
* VSCode or ``ssh`` over a USB network connection,
* VSCode or ``ssh`` over an Ethernet connection,
* VSCode or ``ssh`` over :ref:`BeaglePlay WiFi access point <beagleplay-wifi-access-point>`, or
* :ref:`A local Terminal Emulator session <beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli-xfce>`.

Once you have a shell connection, follow the :ref:`wpa_cli <beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli>` instructions.

BeaglePlay WiFi Access Point
****************************

Running the default image, your BeaglePlay should be hosting a WiFi access point with the SSID "BeaglePlay-XXXX", where *XXXX*
is selected based on a hardware identifier on your board to try to increase the chances it will be unique.

.. tip::
   The "XXXX" will be a combination of numbers and the letters A through F.

.. note::
   At some point, we plan to introduce a captive portal design that will enable using your smartphone to provide
   BeaglePlay local WiFi login information. For now, you'll need to use a computer and 

Step 1. Connect to BeaglePlay-XXXX
==================================

.. tip::
   The password is either "BeaglePlay" or "BeagleBone" and the IP address will be 192.168.8.1.

Whatever your computer provides as a mechanism for searching for WiFi access points and connecting to them, just use that. You
will want to have DHCP enabled, but that is the typical default. Connect to the "BeaglePlay-XXXX" access point and use the password
"BeaglePlay" or "BeagleBone".

.. note::
   The configuration for the access point is in the file system at ``/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf``.

Once your are connected to the access point, BeaglePlay should provide your computer an IP address and use 192.168.8.1 for
itself. It should also be broadcasting the mDNS name "beagleplay.local".

Step 2. Browse to 192.168.8.1
=============================

Once you have connected to the access point, you can simply open VSCode by browsing to `https://192.168.8.1:3000 <https://192.168.8.1:3000>`__.

Within VSCode, you can press "CTRL-\`" to open a terminal session to get access to a shell connection.

You could also choose to `ssh` into your board via `ssh debian@192.168.8.1` and use the password `temppwd`.

.. important::
   Once logged in, you should change the default password using the `passwd` command.

.. _beagleplay-wifi-wpa-gui:

wpa_gui
********

Simplest way to connect to WiFi is to use ``wpa_gui`` tool pre-installed on your BeaglePlay. 
Follow simple steps below to connect to any WiFi access point.

Step 1: Starting wpa_gui
=========================

You can start ``wpa_gui`` either from ``Applications > Internet > wpa_gui`` or double click on the ``wpa_gui`` desktop application shortcut.

Step 2: Understanding wpa_gui interface
========================================

Let's see the ``wpa_gui`` interface in detail,

1. ``Adapter`` is the WiFi interface device, it should be ``wlan0`` (on-board WiFi) by default.
2. ``Network`` shows the WiFi access point ``SSID`` if you are connected to that network.
3. ``Current Status`` tab shows you network information if you are connected to any network.
    - Click on ``Connect`` to connect if not automatically done.
    - Click on ``Disconnect`` to disconnect/reset the connection.
    - Click on ``Scan`` to scan nearby WiFi access points.
4. ``Manage Network`` tab shows you all the saved networks and options to manage those.

Step 3: Scanning & Connecting to WiFi access points
====================================================

To scan the WiFi access points around you, just click on ``Scan`` button availale under 
``wpa_gui > Current Status > Scan``.

    Scanning WiFi access points

A new window will open up with,

1. SSID (WiFi name)
2. BSSID
3. Frequency
4. Signal strength
5. flags

Now, you just have to double click on the Network you want to connect to as shown below.

.. note:: 
    SSIDs and BSSIDs are not fully visible in screenshot below 
    but you can change the column length to see the WiFi names better.

.. important::
   The single quotes around the double quotes are needed to make sure the
   double quotes are given to :ref:`wpa_cli instructions <beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli>`. It expects to see them.

.. note::
   For more information about :ref:`wpa_cli instructions <beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli>`, see https://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/

To make these changes persistent, you need to edit `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`. 
This is described in *wpa_cli (XFCE)* section.

.. _beagleplay-wifi-wpa-cli-xfce:

wpa_cli (XFCE)
**************

Another way of connecting to a WiFi access point is to edit the ``wpa_supplicant`` configuration file.


Step 1: Open up termina
========================

Open up a terminal window either from ``Applications > Terminal Emulator`` Or from Task Manager.

.. figure:: ../images/wpa_cli_step1a.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Open terminal from Applications > Terminal Emulator

    Open terminal from Applications > Terminal Emulator    

.. figure:: ../images/wpa_cli_step1b.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Open terminal from Task Manager

    Open terminal from Task Manager

Step 2: Setup credentials
===========================

To setup credentials of your WiFi access point follow these steps,

1. Execute ``sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf``, 
which will open up ``wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`` inside ``nano`` (terminal based) text editor.
1. Edit ``wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf`` to add SSID (WiFi name) & PSK (WiFi password) of your WiFi access point.

.. code-block::

    ....
    network={
            ssid="WiFi Name"
            psk="WiFi Password"
            ....
    }

1. Now save the details using ``ctrl + O`` then enter.
2. To exit out of the ``nano`` text editor use ``ctrl + X``.

.. figure:: ../images/wpa_cli_step2c.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Save credentials and Exit

    Save credentials (ctrl + O) and Exit (ctrl + X)

Step 3: Reconfigure wlan0
==========================

The WiFi doesn't automatically connect to your WiFi access point 
after you add the credentials to ``wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf``. 

1. To connect you can either execute ``sudo wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure`` 
2. Or Reboot your device by executing ``reboot`` inside your terminal window.
3. Execute ``ping 8.8.8.8`` to check your connection. Use ``ctrl + C`` to quit.

.. code-block:: console

    debian@BeaglePlay:~$ ping 8.8.8.8

Disabling the WIFI Access Point
*******************************

In certain situations, such as running HomeAssistant, you may chose to connect your BeaglePlay to the internet via Ethernet. In this case, it may be desireable to disable it's Wifi access point so that users outside the local network aren't able to connect to it.  

The Wifi Access Point that BeaglePlay provides is started using `uDev rules <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev>`_. created by the `bb-wlan0-defaults` package

You can simply remove the `bb-wlan0-defaults` package:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt remove bb-wlan0-defaults

Now just reboot and the Wifi Access point should no longer start. 

You can also disable it by removing the two following udev rule files:

.. code-block:: shell

    rm /etc/udev/rules.d/81-add-SoftAp0-interface.rules 
    rm /etc/udev/rules.d/82-SoftAp0-start-hostpad.rules

The issue with doing this latter option is that if you later update your OS, the bb-wlan0-defaults may get updated as well and re-add the rules.  

Re-Enabling the WIFI Access Point
*********************************

Conversely, you can re-enable the access point by re-installing the `bb-wlan0-default` package.

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt install bb-wlan0-defaults --reinstall

Now just reboot.
