Using mikroBUS
##############

Steps:

1. Identify if mikroBUS add-on includes a ClickID with ``manifest``. If not, ``manifest`` must be supplied.
2. Identify if mikroBUS add-on is supported by the kernel. If not, kernel module must be added.
3. Identify how driver exposes the data: IIO, net, etc.
4. Connect and power
5. Verify and utilize

Using boards with ClickID
*************************

What is mikroBUS?
=================

mikroBUS is an open standard for add-on boards for sensors, connectivity, displays, storage and more with over 1,400 available from just a single source, `MikroE <https://www.mikroe.com/click>`_. With the flexibility of all of the most common embedded serial busses, UART, I2C and SPI, along with ADC, PWM and GPIO functions, it is a great solution for connecting all sorts of electronics.

.. note::

What is ClickID?
================

ClickID enables mikroBUS add-on boards to be identified along with the configuration required to use it with the mikroBUS Linux driver. The configuration portion is called a ``manifest``.

.. note::

   Learn more at https://github.com/MikroElektronika/click_id

BeaglePlay's Linux kernel is patched with a mikrobus driver that automatically reads the ClickID and loads a driver, greatly simplifying usage.

Does my add-on have ClickID?
============================

Look for the board's ``'D`` (ID) logo. It's near the PWM pin on the upper right-hand side in the illustration below.

   mikroBUS clickID - BeaglePlay connection

If your add-on has ClickID, simply connect it while BeaglePlay is powered off and then apply power.

Example of examining boot log to see a ClickID was detected.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ dmesg | grep mikrobus
   [    2.096254] mikrobus:mikrobus_port_register: registering port mikrobus-0

   [    2.663783] mikrobus mikrobus-0: registering device : opt3001

.. note::
   
   Not all Click boards with ClickID have valid ``manifest`` entries. 
   Then you can follow :ref:`beagleplay-mikrobus-clickid-inavalid-manifests` to make your 
   add-on detected.

To use the add-on, see :ref:`beagleplay-mikrobus-using`.

.. _beagleplay-mikrobus-without-clickid:

What if my add-on doesn't have ClickID?
=======================================
If add-on doesn't have clickID then it can not be detected directly.

.. code:: shell-session 

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ dmesg | grep mikrobus
   [    2.123994] mikrobus:mikrobus_port_register: registering port mikrobus-0 
   [    2.124059] mikrobus mikrobus-0: mikrobus port 0 eeprom empty probing default eeprom

Available ``manifest`` can be installed that has been created for your add-on as we have created over 100 of them. 
You can install the existing manifest files onto your BeaglePlay. First, make sure you have the 
latest manifests installed in your system.

.. code:: console

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install bbb.io-clickid-manifests


Take a look at the list of ``manifest`` files to see if the Click or other mikrobus add-on board ``manifest`` is installed.

Then, load the appropriate ``manifest`` using the ``mikrobus`` bus driver. For example, with the Ambient 2 Click, 
you can write that ``manifest`` to the ``mikrobus-0`` ``new_device`` entry.

.. code:: bash

   cat /lib/firmware/mikrobus/AMBIENT-2-CLICK.mnfb > /sys/bus/mikrobus/devices/mikrobus-0/new_device

You can now exit this shell.

What if my add-on has invalid manifest entries?
===============================================

Not all Click boards with ClickID have valid manifest entries. 
If your add-on has clickID but shows the command output like below.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ dmesg | grep mikrobus
   [    2.119771] mikrobus:mikrobus_port_register: registering port mikrobus-0
   [    2.119842] mikrobus mikrobus-0: mikrobus port 0 eeprom empty probing default eeprom
   [    2.261113] mikrobus_manifest:mikrobus_manifest_header_validate: manifest version too new (150.189 > 0.3)
   [    2.261130] mikrobus mikrobus-0: invalid manifest size -22

There are some available manifest that can be used to write in the eeprom of clickID board.
Once you ``sudo apt update`` and ``sudo apt install bbb.io-clickid-manifests`` then you
can see the list of manifests using command ``ls /lib/firmware/mikrobus/``. Let's take 
the ``Accel Click - ClickID`` Board with invalid manifest entries, To get the valid manifest
we need to write ``ACCEL-CLICK.mnfb`` to eeprom of ClickID board using the following commands.

First check the file name for the add-on device. It can be in the form of ``w1_bus_master1-xx-xxxxxxx``.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
   w1_bus_master1  w1_bus_master1-xx-xxxxxxx

Then in the following command, ``/lib/firmware/mikrobus/ACCEL-CLICK.mnfb`` is the path of manifest file and 
``/sys/bus/w1/devices/w1_bus_master1-xx-xxxxxxx/mikrobus_manifest`` is path for one wire eeprom clickID board. 
You must replace the the file name ``w1_bus_master1-xx-xxxxxxx`` with your clickID board file in the
below command.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ sudo dd if=/lib/firmware/mikrobus/ACCEL-CLICK.mnfb of=/sys/bus/w1/devices/w1_bus_master1-xx-xxxxxxx/mikrobus_manifest
   0+1 records in
   0+1 records out
   132 bytes copied, 0.0144496 s, 9.1 kB/s

Now, Reboot your BeaglePlay. After rebooting, the add-on has been detected with valid manifest entries.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ dmesg | grep mikrobus
   [    2.126654] mikrobus:mikrobus_port_register: registering port mikrobus-0 
   [    2.126727] mikrobus mikrobus-0: mikrobus port 0 eeprom empty probing default eeprom

   [    2.797267] mikrobus mikrobus-0: registering device : adxl345

.. note::

   The updation has done in the eeprom of clickID board. It will not 
   forget after reboot.

.. note::

   We will be adding a link to the ``mikrobus-0`` device at ``/dev/play/mikrobus`` in the near
   future, but you can find it for now at ``/sys/bus/mikrobus/devices/mikrobus-0``. If you
   need to supply an ID (manifest), this is the directory where you will do it.

Accel Click Board Example
==========================

Next, let's explore how to read raw sensor values using the Accel Click board. This step will help us understand the basics of sensor data retrieval and processing.

First, let's check the IIO devices available.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ ls /sys/bus/iio/devices/
   iio:device0  iio:device1

Considering the device ``iio:device0`` is the MikroBUS click ID connected to the BeaglePlay board.
Depending on your specific setup and device configuration, you might need to adjust the path or device
number (device0) accordingly. In this case device0 corresponds to our Accel Click, let's check its name.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/name
   adxl345

The file corresponding to the IIO device, including raw values, can be viewed using the following command:

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ ls /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0
   dev                          in_accel_scale        in_accel_x_raw        in_accel_y_raw        in_accel_z_raw  power                         subsystem
   in_accel_sampling_frequency  in_accel_x_calibbias  in_accel_y_calibbias  in_accel_z_calibbias  name            sampling_frequency_available  uevent

To view the raw values from the accel click (assuming ``iio:device0`` is configured correctly for your MikroBUS
click ID on the BeaglePlay board), you can use the following command:

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_x_raw
   3

This command reads and displays the raw X-axis accelerometer data from ``iio:device0``. You can replace
``in_accel_x_raw`` with ``in_accel_y_raw`` or ``in_accel_z_raw`` to view raw data from the Y-axis or Z-axis
accelerometer channels respectively, depending on your requirements.


To create a script displays accelerometer raw data values from ``iio:device0`` use ``nano accelclick.sh`` command.
Copy the below script and paste it to the ``accelclick.sh`` file. It reads the raw X, Y, and Z axis values from 
``/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_accel_x_raw``, ``/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_accel_y_raw``, and
``/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_accel_z_raw`` respectively.

.. code:: shell-session

   X=$(cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_x_raw)
   Y=$(cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_y_raw)
   Z=$(cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_accel_z_raw)
   echo "X = ${X}        Y = ${Y}      Z= ${Z}"

.. note::

   Adjust the device path ``iio:device0`` according to your setup. Also, ensure that your system 
   and hardware configuration are correctly set up to provide live accelerometer data through these paths.

To make the script file executable, use the following command:

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ chmod +x accelclick.sh 

When you run ``watch -n 0.5 ./accelclick.sh``, the watch command will execute ``./accelclick.sh`` every 0.5 seconds 
and display its output in the terminal.

.. code:: shell-session

   debian@BeaglePlay:~$ watch -n 0.5 ./accelclick.sh 

This is the output of your accelclick.sh script. It shows the current values of the X, Y, and Z axis of your accelerometer in raw form.

.. code:: shell-session

   Every 0.5s: ./accelclick.sh

   X = 3        Y = 11      Z= 284


Using boards with Linux drivers
*******************************

Depending on the type of mikrobus add-on board, the Linux driver could be of various different types. For sensors, the most common is :ref:`beagleplay-mikrobus-using-iio`.


.. _beagleplay-mikrobus-using-iio:

IIO driver
==========

Per https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/iio/intro.html,

    The main purpose of the Industrial I/O subsystem (IIO) is to provide support for devices that in some sense perform either analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) or digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) or both. The aim is to fill the gap between the somewhat similar hwmon and input subsystems. Hwmon is directed at low sample rate sensors used to monitor and control the system itself, like fan speed control or temperature measurement. Input is, as its name suggests, focused on human interaction input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen). In some cases there is considerable overlap between these and IIO.

    Devices that fall into this category include:

    * analog to digital converters (ADCs)
    * accelerometers
    * capacitance to digital converters (CDCs)
    * digital to analog converters (DACs)
    * gyroscopes
    * inertial measurement units (IMUs)
    * color and light sensors
    * magnetometers
    * pressure sensors
    * proximity sensors
    * temperature sensors


See also https://wiki.analog.com/software/linux/docs/iio/iio.

To discover IIO driver enabled devices, use the ``iio_info`` command.

Disabling the mikroBUS driver
*****************************

If you'd like to use other means to control the mikroBUS connector, you might want to disable the mikroBUS driver. This is most easily done by enabling a device tree overlay at boot.

.. todo::

    Document kernel version that integrates this overlay and where to get update instructions.

.. note::

    To utilize the overlay with these instructions, make sure to have TBD version of kernel, modules and firmware installed. Use `uname -a` to determine the currently running kernel version. See TBD for information on how to update.

Apply overlay to disable mikrobus0 instance.

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "    fdtoverlays /overlays/k3-am625-beagleplay-release-mikrobus.dtbo" | sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/extlinux/extlinux.conf
    sudo shutdown -r now

Log back in after reboot and verify the device driver did not capture the busses.

.. code-block:: console

    debian@BeaglePlay:~$ ls /dev/play

To re-enable.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo sed -e '/release-mikrobus/ s/^#*/#/' -i /boot/firmware/extlinux/extlinux.conf
    sudo shutdown -r now

Verify driver is enabled again.
