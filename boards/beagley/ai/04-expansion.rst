   Describe how to build expansion hardware for BeagleY-AI. This section is not about using existing add-on hardware.

PCIe

For software reference, you can :ref:`see how PCIe is used on NVMe HATs<beagley-ai-expansion-nvme>`.


CSI
***

For software reference, you can :ref:`see how CSI is used on IMX219-based camera modules<beagley-ai-imx219-csi-cameras>`.

RTC

.. todo::

   Remove this. I really don't see how "RTC" falls into our definition of what should be documented in "Expansion".
