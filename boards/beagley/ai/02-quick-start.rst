Getting started
****************

To get started your BeagleY-AI you need the following:

1. :ref:`5V @ 3A power supply <accessories-power-supplies>`
2. MicromicroSD card (32GB)
3. :ref:`beagley-ai-boot-media`

You may need additional accessories based on the mode of operation, you can use your BeagleY-AI in different ways.

1. :ref:`USB Tethering by directly connecting via USB type-c port <beagley-ai-usb-tethering>`
2. :ref:`Headless connection via UART debug port <beagley-ai-headless>`
3. :ref:`Standalone connection with Monitor and other peripherals attached <standalone-connection>`

Easiest option is to connect the board directly to your PC or Laptop using a USB type-C to type-c cable. There is only one USB type-C port on board, if you 
choose to use a dedicated power supply for first time setup, you may choose to access the board via any other methods listed above.

Power Supply
**************

To power the board you can either connect it to a dedicated power supply like a mobile charger or a wall adapter that 
can provide 5V ≥ 3A. Checkout the :ref:`docs power supply page <accessories-power-supplies>` for power supply recommendations.

.. note:: 
    Instead of using a :ref:`power supply or power adapter <accessories-power-supplies>` if you are using a :ref:`Type-C to Type-C cable 
    <accessories-cables-usb>` to connect the board to your laptop/PC then make sure it can supply at least 1000mA.

Balena Etcher
==============

Download and install `Balena Etcher <https://etcher.balena.io/>`_ and then download the boot media from
`https://www.beagleboard.org/distros/beagley-ai-debian-12-5-2024-06-19-xfce <https://www.beagleboard.org/distros/beagley-ai-debian-12-5-2024-06-19-xfce>`_. 
Flash it on a microSD card using `Balena Etcher <https://etcher.balena.io/>`_ following the steps below:

1. Select downloaded boot media
2. Select microSD card 
3. Flash!

.. tip:: For more detailed steps checkout the :ref:`beagleboard-getting-started` under support section of the documentation.

.. figure:: images/balena-etcher.*

Once the microSD card is flashed you should see ``BOOT`` and ``rootfs`` mounted on your system as shown in image below,

.. figure:: images/disk.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Flashed microSD card mounted partitions

    Flashed microSD card mounted partitions

Under ``BOOT`` partition open ``sysconf.txt`` to edit login ``username`` and ``password``.

.. figure:: images/sysconf.*
    :align: center
    :alt: sysconf file under BOOT partition

    sysconf file under BOOT partition

In ``sysconf.txt`` file you have to edit the two lines highlighted below. 

.. callout::

    .. code-block:: text
        :linenos:
        :lineno-start: 29
        :emphasize-lines: 2,5

        # user_name - Set a user name for the user (1000)
        #user_name=beagle <1>

        # user_password - Set a password for user (1000)
        #user_password=FooBar <2>

    .. annotations::

        <1> If ``boris`` is your username, update ``#user_name=beagle`` to ``user_name=boris``

        <2> If ``bash`` is your password, update ``#user_password=FooBar`` to ``user_password=bash``

.. important::
    
    1. Make sure to remove ``#`` from ``#user_name=`` and ``#user_password=`` else the lines will be interpreted as a comment and your username & password will not be updated.
    2. If you do not change your username and passord here then you will not see any output on your HDMI monitor when you do a :ref:`standalone-connection` setup.


Once username and password are updated, you can insert the microSD card into 
your BeagleY-AI as shown in the image below:

.. figure:: images/beagley-ai-micro-sd-card.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Insert microSD card in BeagleY-AI

    Insert microSD card in BeagleY-AI

.. _beagley-ai-usb-tethering:

USB Tethering
**************

.. note:: 
    If you are using the board with a fan or running a computationally intensive 
    task you should always power the board with a dedicated power supply that can supply 5V ≥ 3A (15W+). 

    As per USB standards these are the current at 5V that each downstream USB port type can (max) supply:

    - USB Type-A 3.x port - 900mA (4.5W)
    - USB Type-C 1.2 port - 1500mA (7.5W) to 3000mA (15W)

    Thus it's recommended to use type-C to type-C cable.

To initially test your board, you can connect the board directly to your computer using a ``type-C to type-C`` cable shown in the image below.

.. figure:: images/beagley-ai-tethered-connection.*

    :alt: BeagleY-AI tethered connection

    BeagleY-AI tethered connection

SSH connection
===============

After connecting, you should see the power LED glow, and soon just like with other Beagles, BeagleY-AI will create a virtual wired connection on your computer. 
To access the board, open up a terminal (`Linux <https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Ubuntu>`_/`Mac <https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac>`_) 
or command prompt (`Windows <https://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows>`_) and use the SSH command as shown below.

.. code:: shell
    
    ssh debian@192.168.7.2

.. important:: Here ``debian`` is the default username, make sure to replace ``debian`` with the ``username`` you selected during :ref:`beagley-ai-boot-media` prepration step.

.. tip:: If you are not able to find your beagle at ``192.168.7.2``, checkout :ref:`start-browse-to-beagle` to resolve your connection issue.

.. important:: If you have not updated your default username and password during :ref:`beagley-ai-boot-media`, you must update the default password at this step to something safer.

.. figure:: images/ssh-connection.*

.. _beagley-ai-uart-connection:

UART connection
================

Your BeagleY-AI board creates a UART connection (No additional hardware required) when tethered to a Laptop/PC which you can access using ``Putty`` of ``tio``. 
On a linux machine it may come up as ``dev/ttyACM*``, it will be different for Mac and Windows operatig systems. To find serial port for your system you can checkout 
`this guide <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/supportpkg/find-arduino-port-on-windows-mac-and-linux.html;jsessionid=c2d3127cd10411c66f33468cbd5b>`_.

.. figure:: images/uart/putty.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Putty serial connection

    Putty serial connection

- If you are on linux, try ``tio`` with default setting using command below,

.. code:: console

    tio /dev/ttyACM0

With this you have the access to BeagleY-AI terminal. Now, you can connect your board to :ref:`WiFi <beagley-ai-connecting-wifi>`, 
try out all the :ref:`cool demos <beagley-ai-demos>` and explore all the other ways to access your BeagleY-AI listed below.

.. _beagley-ai-headless:

Headless connection
===================

If you want to run your BeagleY-AI in headless mode, you need `Raspberry Pi Debug Probe <https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html>`_ 
or similar serial (USB to UART) adapter. Connect your UART debug probe to BeagleY-AI as shown in the image below. After making the connection you can use command 
line utility like ``tio`` on Linux of Putty on any operating system. Check :ref:`beagley-ai-uart-connection` for more information.

.. _standalone-connection:

Standalone connection
=====================

.. important:: 
    Make sure to update your ``username`` and ``password`` during 
    :ref:`beagley-ai-boot-media` prepration step else you'll not see any output on you HDMI monitor.

To setup your BeagleY-AI for standalone usage, you need the following additional accessories,

1. HDMI monitor
2. micro HDMI to full-size HDMI cable
3. Wireless keyboard & mice combo
4. Ethernet cable (Optional)

Make sure you have the microSD card with boot media (software image) inserted in to the BeagleY-AI. Now connect,

1. microHDMI to BeagleY-AI and full size HDMI to monitor
2. keyboard and mice combo to one of the four USB port of BeagleY-AI
3. Power supply to USB type-c connector of BeagleY-AI
