Booting from NVMe Drives
##########################

BeagleY-AI supports a PCI-Express x1 interface which enables data rates of up to 1GB/s for high speed expansion. 

.. note:: While the SoC supports PCI-e Gen 3, the flat-flex connector required by HATs is only rated for PCI-e Gen 2, so, as is the case with other similar boards in this form factor, actual transfer speeds may be limited to Gen 2, depending on a variety of layout and environmental factors

This enables it to take advantage of standard PC NVMe drives which offer exponentially higher random and sequential read/write speeds as well as improved endurance over SD cards or traditional eMMC storage.

While the boot-ROM on the AM67 SoC does not support direct boot-to-NVMe, we can use a method where we boot U-Boot from the SD Card and then use it to load the Linux filesystem from external NVMe storage. 

Verified HATs and Drives
***************************

Most/All HATs and NVMe drives should work, but the following have been verified to work as part of writing this guide:

HATs:
1. Geekworm X1001 PCIe to M.2 Key-M (`Amazon Link <https://www.amazon.com/Geekworm-X1001-Key-M-Peripheral-Raspberry/dp/B0CPPGGDQT>`_.)
2. Geekworm X1000 PCIe M.2 Key-M (`Amazon Link <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQ4D2C9S>`_.)

NVMe drives:

1. Kingston OM3PDP3512B (512GB 2230) -  (`Amazon Link <https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-512GB-3-0x4-Solid-OM3PDP3512B-A01/dp/B0BW7V8ZZ3>`_.)
2. Kingston NV2 (512GB 2280) - (`Amazon Link <https://www.amazon.com/Kingston-500G-2280-Internal-SNV2S/dp/B0BBWJH1P8/>`_.)

Drive Adapters (3D Printable):

The X1000 above uses the slightly uncommon 2242 drive size, so, an adapter may be required to mount a 2230 drive. 
A simple adapter from @eliasjonsson on Printables works great - https://www.printables.com/model/578236-m2-ssd-2230-to-2242 
Similar Adapters exist for 2230 to 2280 for example such as this one from @nzalog - https://www.printables.com/model/217264-2230-to-2280-m2-adapter-ssd

Step 1. Boot from SD Normally
**********************************

.. note:: This article was written using the (`BeagleY-AI Debian XFCE 12.5 2024-03-25 <https://www.beagleboard.org/distros/beagley-ai-debian-xfce-12-5-2024-03-25/>`_.) image.  

Grab the latest BeagleY-AI SD Image from (`BeagleBoard.org/distros <https://www.beagleboard.org/distros>`_.) 

Once logged in and at the terminal, make sure your system is up to date (a reboot is also recommended after updating)

.. code:: console

   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
   sudo reboot


Step 2. Verify that your NVMe drive is detected
************************************************************

The command ``lspci`` will list the attached PCI Express devices on the system:

.. code:: console
    debian@BeagleY:~$ lspci    

You should see an output similar to the following, where the first entrance is the SoC internal PCI Express bridge device and the second device listed is your NVMe drive, in this case, a Kingston OM3PDP3 drive.

.. code:: console

    00:00.0 PCI bridge: Texas Instruments Device b010
    01:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Kingston Technology Company, Inc. OM3PDP3 NVMe SSD (rev 01)

Now that we know the PCIe device is detected, let's see if it's recognized as a Storage Device:

The command ``lsblk`` will list the attached storage devices on the system:

.. code:: console
    debian@BeagleY:~$ lsblk
    NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    mmcblk0     179:0    0  59.7G  0 disk
    ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot/firmware
    └─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  59.4G  0 part /
    nvme0n1     259:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
    └─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0 476.9G  0 part 

Here we see that two devices are connected, ``mmcblk0`` corresponds to our SD card, and ``nvme0n1`` corresponds to our NVMe drive, so everything is ready to go!


If your drives aren't listed as expected, please check the Troubleshooting section at the end of this document. 


Step 3. Copy your filesystem and modify extlinux.conf for NVMe boot
***************************************************************************

A variety of useful scripts are available  in ``/opt/``, one of them enables us to move our micro-sd contents to NVMe and make BeagleY-AI boot from there directly.

The following 3 commands will change your U-boot prompt to boot from NVMe by default, but the serial boot menu will still enable you to fall back to SD boot or other modes if something happens.

.. note:: This will copy the entire contents of your SD card to the NVMe drive, so expect it to take upwards of 15 minutes. This only needs to be run one time

.. code:: bash

   sudo cp -v /opt/u-boot/bb-u-boot-beagley-ai/beagley-microsd-to-nvme /etc/default/beagle-flasher
   sudo beagle-flasher-boot-emmc-rootfs-nvme
   sudo reboot 

Enjoy NVMe speeds!
***************

Now that we've run the scripts above, you should see that lsblk now reports that our ``/`` or root filesystem is on the ``nvme0n1p1`` partition, meaning we are successfully booting from the NVMe drive.

It's subtle, but the change can be seen by running ``lsblk`` again.

.. code:: console
    debian@BeagleY:~$ lsblk
    NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    mmcblk0     179:0    0  59.7G  0 disk
    ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   256M  0 part /boot/firmware
    └─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  59.4G  0 part 
    nvme0n1     259:0    0 476.9G  0 disk
    └─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0 476.9G  0 part /

Congratulations! 

Troubleshooting
********************

While most setups should work, it is possible that a combination of Software, Hardware or both can result in minor issues. Here are some ideas for troubleshooting on your own:

Check that your cables are plugged in and oriented correctly
***

The flat-flex ribbon cable will only connect correctly one way, so ensure the orientation is correct with your expansion HAT manual and that the ribbon cable is correctly seated. 

A note on power-hungry drives
***

While most drives can be powered as-is with only the ribbon cable, some drives, especially high end full-size 2280 drives may consume more power than normal for an M.2 connector. 
For such cases, some HAT expansions will provide a means of providing external supplemental power. If your drive is not detected, it may be worthwhile to try using a drive from a different manufacturer as a troubleshooting step.

As a side note, since 2230 drives are normally designed to run in Laptops, they tend to also consume less power than their desktop counterparts and as such, are a "safer" option.

Check the Linux Kernel Logs for PCI:
***

You should see something similar to below without further errors:

.. code:: console

    debian@BeagleY:~$ dmesg | grep "PCI"
    [    0.005276] PCI/MSI: /bus@f0000/interrupt-controller@1800000/msi-controller@1820000 domain created

    [    3.674209] j721e-pcie-host f102000.pcie: PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
    [    3.742406] pci 0000:01:00.0: 7.876 Gb/s available PCIe bandwidth, limited by 8.0 GT/s PCIe x1 link at 0000:00:00.0 (capable of 31.504 Gb/s with 8.0 GT/s PCIe x4 link)
