    The accessories section only contains a subset of 3rd party products that have been manually used by community members with BeagleBoard.org products. 
    BeagleBoard.org should not be held liable for the functionality of BeagleBoard.org products in association with these 3rd party 
    products in any way possible. This is just a place for people to report their experiences and not a statement of compatibility. 
    BeagleBoard.org approve that these items have at least some aspect of testing by foundation members, though only specific 
    versions and it is up to the manufacturers of those items to maintain compatibility.
