The following monitors and resolutions have been tested for operation with the BeagleBone Black. 
Check here often as we will update the list as we confirm the operation. Let

model and resolution at which it works and we will add it to the list. Only the highest 
resolution is listed below.

    All the monitors most likely will work with AI-64 also but, make sure that 
    you are using active miniDP to HDMI converter becuase passive convertor will not work.
