BeagleConnect™ Technology
##########################

.. important::

   Currently under development

BeagleConnect™ is a revolutionary technology virtually eliminating low-level  software development for `IoT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>`_ and `IIoT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_internet_of_things>`_ applications, such as building automation, factory automation, home automation, and scientific data acquisition. 

While numerous IoT and IIoT solutions available today provide massive software libraries for microcontrollers supporting a limited body of `sensors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor>`_, `actuators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator>`_ and `indicators <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_(distance_amplifying_instrument)>`_ as well as libraries for communicating over various networks, BeagleConnect™ simply eliminates the need for these libraries by shifting the burden into the  most massive and collaborative software project of all time, the `Linux kernel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel>`_.

These are the tools used to automate things in `scientific data collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection_system>`_, `data science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science>`_, `mechatronics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics>`_, and `IoT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>`_.

BeagleConnect™ technology solves:

* The need to write software to add a large set of diverse devices to your system,
* The need to maintain the software with security updates,
* The need to rapidly prototype using off-the-shelf software and hardware without wiring,
* The need to connect to devices using long-range, low-power wireless, and
* The need to produce high-volume custom hardware cost-optimized for your requirements.
