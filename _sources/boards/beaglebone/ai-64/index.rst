###################

BeagleBone® AI-64 brings a complete system for developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
solutions with the convenience and expandability of the BeagleBone® platform and the peripherals on board to
get started right away learning and building applications. With locally hosted, ready-to-use, open-source
focused tool chains and development environment, a simple web browser, power source and network connection
are all that need to be added to start building performance-optimized embedded applications. Industry-leading
expansion possibilities are enabled through familiar BeagleBone® cape headers, with hundreds of open-source
hardware examples and dozens of readily available embedded expansion options available off-the-shelf.
