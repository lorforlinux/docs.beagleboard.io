BeagleBone (all)
###################

BeagleBone boards are intended to be bare-bones, with a balance of features to enable
rapid prototyping and provide a solid reference for building end products.

The most popular design is :ref:`beagleboneblack-home`, a staple reference for an open hardware
embedded Linux single board computer.

:ref:`bbai64-home` is our most powerful design with tremendous machine learning inference
performance, 64-bit processing and a mixture of microcontrollers for various types of
highly-reliable and low-latency control.

For simplicity of developing small, mobile robotics, check out :ref:`beaglebone-blue-home`, a highly
integrated board with motor drivers, battery support, altimeter, gyroscope, accelerometer,
and much more to get started developing quickly.

The System Reference Manual for each BeagleBone board is below. Older boards are supported
with links to their latest PDF-formatted System Reference Manual and the latest boards are
included both here and in the downloadable beagleboard-docs.pdf linked on the bottom-left
of your screen.

All boards received without RMA approval will not be worked on.
