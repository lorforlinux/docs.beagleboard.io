BeagleConnect Freedom
#####################

BeagleConnect™ Freedom is an open-hardware wireless hardware platform developed by BeagleBoard.org and built around the TI CC1352P7 microcontroller, which supports both 
2.4-GHz and long-range, low-power Sub-1 GHz wireless protocols. Rapidly prototyping of IoT applications is accelerated by hardware compatibility with over 1,000 mikroBUS add-on sensors,
acutators, indicators and additional connectivity and storage options, and backed with software support utilizing the Zephyr scalable and modular real-time operating system, allowing developers
to tailor the solution to their specific needs.  BeagleConnect Freedom further includes MSP430F5503 for USB-to-UART functionality, temperature and humidity sensor, light sensor, SPI flash,
battery charger, buzzer, LEDs, and JTAG connections to make it a comprehensive solution for IoT development and prototyping.

The TI CC1352P7 microcontroller (MCU) includes a 48-MHz Arm Cortex-M4F processor, 704KB Flash memory, 256KB ROM, 8KB Cache SRAM, 144KB of ultra-low leakage SRAM, and
over-the-air upgrades (OTA) capability. This MCU provides flexible support for many different protocols and bands making it suitable for many different communication requirements.
