Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
############################

GSoC offers a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in open-source development, work closely with mentors, and make significant contributions to coding projects. Beyond the summer, many participants find themselves forging lifelong connections with the open-source community.

BeagleBoard.org actively participates in the Google Summer of Code program as a mentorship organization. This page serves as a hub for mentors and mentees interested in participating in GSoC with BeagleBoard.

Google Summer of Code is open to individuals age 18 and older in most countries who are new or beginner contributors to open source coding projects.
