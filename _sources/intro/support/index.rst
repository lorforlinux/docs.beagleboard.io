Getting support
***************

BeagleBoard.org products are `open
hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`_ designs supported
via the on-line community resources. We are very confident in our
community’s ability to provide useful answers in a timely manner. If you
don’t get a productive response within 24 hours, please escalate issues
to Jason Kridner (contact info available on the `About
Page <https://www.beagleboard.org/about>`_). In case it is needed, Jason
will help escalate issues to suppliers, manufacturers or others. Be sure
to provide a link to your questions on the `community
forums <https://forum.beagleboard.org>`_ as answers will be provided
there.

Be sure to ask `smart questions <http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>`_
that provide the following:

*  What are you trying to accomplish?
*  What did you find when researching how to accomplish it?
*  What are the detailed results of what you tried?
*  How did these results differ from what you expected?
*  What would you consider to be a success?

.. important::
   Remember that community developers are volunteering their expertise. Respect
   developers time and expertise and they might be happy to share with you. If you
   want paid support, there are :ref:`consulting-resources` options for that.
