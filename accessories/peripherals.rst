    Make sure you are powering BeagleBone with decent power supply with 
    enough current before attaching any additional peripherals. If you require many USB peripheral USB devices to be attached, consider using a "Powered USB Hub"
    See :ref:`accessories-power-supplies` for more information on power requirements.
