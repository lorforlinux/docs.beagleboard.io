Welcome to the `BeagleBoard project documentation <https://git.beagleboard.org/docs/docs.beagleboard.io>`_.
If you are looking for help with your Beagle open-hardware development platform, you've found the right place!

.. note:: 
   The BeagleBoard.org Foundation is a US-based 501(c)3 non-profit organization providing open hardware
   computing solutions for a community of makers, educators and professionals that enable
   rapid prototyping without barriers to creating real-world embedded systems. The BeagleBoard.org Foundation
   supports the BeagleBoard community through efforts like developing this documentation.

Introduction

Boards
******

This is where you will find the System Reference Manuals (SRMs) for all of the boards.

All Beagles are `open-hardware <https://www.oshwa.org/definition/>`__ with documentation on the
design, including the
`materials <https://git.beagleboard.org/explore/projects/topics/boards>`__ to modify the designs
from source using appropriate design tools.

* Check out our easy-to-use Linux-based board at: :ref:`beagleplay-home`
* Check out our highest performance (8 TOPs) board at: :ref:`bbai64-home`
* Check out our first Zephyr-based board at: :ref:`beagleconnect-freedom-home`
