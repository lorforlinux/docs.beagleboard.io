.. important::
   First off, thanks for taking the time to think about contributing!

.. note::
   For donations, see `BeagleBoard.org - Donate <https://beagleboard.org/donate>`__.

The BeagleBoard.org Foundation maintains source for many open source projects.

Example projects suitable for first contributions:

* `BeagleBoard project documentation <https://openbeagle.org/docs/docs.beagleboard.io>`__
* `Debian image bug repository <https://openbeagle.org/beagleboard/Latest-Images>`__
* `Debian image builder <https://openbeagle.org/beagleboard/image-builder>`__

These guidelines are mostly suggestions, not hard-set rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free
to propose changes to this document in a merge request.

.. todo::
   We need some kind of documentation on how the build process runs and how Sphinx is
   configured. This `conf.yml` file is just a mystery, with insufficient information on
   the provided interface.
